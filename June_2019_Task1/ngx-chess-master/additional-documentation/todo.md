## TODOs:
 
 * Integration with FireBase (for P2P play, save, etc...)
 * Promotion popup (currently defaults to Queen) 
 * More boards / engines?
 * Change DI, board will get controller when new game is set (controller will hold engine via DI)?
 * NPM Publish script + publish
 * ~~Next move hint~~
 * ~~Undo~~
 * ~~Move to **Web Worker**, classic web worker use case~~ (native, none angular)
 * ~~Lazy load the Chessjs-AI plugin~~ (done with webpack)
